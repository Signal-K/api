#- `swagger:` tells Connexion what version of the Swagger API is being used
#- `info:` begins a new ‘scope’ of information about the API being built
#- `description:` a user defined description of what the API provides or is about. This is in the Connexion generated UI system
#- `version:` a user defined version value for the API
#- `title:` a user defined title included in the Connexion generated UI system
#- `consumes:` tells Connexion what [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) is expected by the API.
#- `produces:` tells Connexion what content type is expected by the caller of the API.
#- `basePath: "/api"` defines the root of the API, kind of like a [namespace](https://realpython.com/python-namespaces-scope/) the REST API will come from.
